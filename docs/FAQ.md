# In-depth FAQ

### Collisions with other hawken clients
- The launcher **automatically changes the default ini folder** of the PAX Client to `Hawken_PAXPlus`.  
There will be **no collisions with other Hawken clients** installed.<br></br>

### Do I need to mod ini files still?
- **No. The launcher presents all ini options in an in-launcher options menu.**  
The launcher settings page can also be updated remotely & automatically, should new ini tweaks be found.  

- That being said, **you still can edit the ini files if you so wish - but it is no longer required.**  
All ini options are covered, except for control rebinding. <br></br>

### Something I want to set isn't in the launcher options
- **You can pass custom game launch arguments from within the launcher settings page too.**  
They will be passed straight to the game exe, so beware as there is no validation here.  

- **Suggest adding the option to the launcher team.**  
The launcher settings page can be updated remotely without a launcher update, so let us know if think there is an option worth adding <br></br>

### Does the launcher require an internet connection?
- **Only for the first time setup. Patches are cached locally as well to support offline usage.**  
The launcher will be able to repatch your game & ensure patch integrity even with no internet connection.<br></br>

### Do new game patches need to be installed manually?
- **No. All game patch updates are deployed & applied automatically, requiring no user action.**  
The launcher checks for updates periodically & when launching the game.<br></br>

### Does the launcher update itself automatically too?
- **No. Launcher updates require a manual download of the newer version.**  
There will be a notification at the top bar of the launcher, should a newer version be available.

- **You don't have to update right away, older launchers are by default compatible with newer game patches.**  
You will be notified once your launcher version has reached its end of life because of incompatibility with newer patches.

- **End of life launchers no longer receive new game patches, but can keep playing on the latest supported patch for that version.**
<br></br>

### Does deleting the launcher folder also delete my settings?
- **No. All launcher settings are stored in `C:/Users/YOUR_USERNAME/Documents/PAXPlus_Launcher/**   
- You can delete your launcher settings by also deleting that folder.  
Your Launcher will return to the first time setup on next launch. <br></br>
